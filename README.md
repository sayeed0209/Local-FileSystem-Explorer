# Explore the file system with PHP
###### This project main objective is create a system file explorer that allows the user to navigate, create directories and upload files in the same way as he would in his usual operating system.
 
## The pill üöÄ
This project main objective is create a **system file explorer** that allows the user to **navigate**, **create** directories and **upload** files in the same way as he would in his usual operating system.
The file explorer is a tool that **allows** you to directly **view** and **manipulate** the files and directories associated with a path, so you must take into account from which path the user starts and which path they can access.
In our team we try to do a minimalist and functional **file system** based in a simple division in **frontend** and **backend** that one (**backend**) is the responsable to send the file and folder data in **JSON** format and the other (**frontend**) is in charge to transform this information in something visual for the user.
 
## Main objectives üìã
* Understand how the file system works.
* Improve your knowledge in PHP (special the use of files inside a server)
